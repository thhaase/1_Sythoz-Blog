# markdown2website

A while ago I learned about Quarto, was really amazed by it and instantly wanted to start a personal webpage and Blog to try it out. After a while I realized, that downloading an entire Program, just to create a simple static website is way to overengineered considering how easy pure html code is to write. The simplicity and aesthetic of older basic html webpages always intrigued me but I also really liked the Idea to create webpages really easy by just converting markdown files. 


When browsing through Github I found the Blog of Github User [casual writer](https://casualwriter.github.io/blog/) who wrote a simple javascript-translater to do exactly that: use markdown to create html. This was exactly what I wanted, but when trying to modify his code I realized that it shouldn't be too hard to wrrite a tool like his myself.  


I tried to keep everything minimalistic and userfriendly.Creating a website from a folder of markdown notes, such as those commonly used in Obsidian or Zettlr, should ideally only require copying one HTML file containing all necessary JavaScript and CSS. In the end I needed a little more then that, but the principle stayed the same - just create a _media_-folder for all pictures, copy the _source_ and index.html and create a startpage.md. 


I did not add automation for tags etc. like casualwriter did with this tool, because of simplicity and the need to stay abstract to use the tool for different purposes. There might be the paradigm to sort blogposts via tags, but I like the Idea of just reading through ideas wich seem not particularly interested at first - most of the time you learn a lot. Also, thinking about sorting only makes sense after there are already many posts existing and for that I need to write some posts first üòÅ. Even then keeping a little Chaos might enhance creativity and usefulness.
