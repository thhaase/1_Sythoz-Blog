# Comparison Erdös-distances Uni Giessen vs. Würzburg

The Erdős number describes the "collaborative distance" between a person and the prolific Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdős, as measured by authorship of mathematical papers. It is part of the broader concept of the "Erdős number project," which tracks such distances for many mathematicians and scientists.


Here's how it works:

- Erdős himself has an Erdős number of 0.
- A person who has co-authored a paper with Erdős has an Erdős number of 1.
- If a person has not co-authored a paper with Erdős but has co-authored with someone who has an Erdős number of 1, they have an Erdős number of 2, and so on.

Using the following Website of the FIZ you can compute the Erdösnumber between two Mathematicians/Physicists:

According to the FIZ data, the average Erdösnumber of mathematicians in Giessen is lower than the average Erdösnumber of mathematicians in Würzburg: 

| Department  | Erdösnumber       |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| Gießen      | 3,46153846153846  |
| Würzburg    | 3,74418604651163  |
| Difference  | 0,282647584973166 |
